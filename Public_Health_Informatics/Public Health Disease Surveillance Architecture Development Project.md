# Public Health Disease Surveillance Architecture Development Project

## Technical Documentation

### Virtual Machine Configuration

- **Operating Systems**: Configured virtual machine environments for five entities: Aspirus Hospital, Portage Health Hospital, Baraga County Memorial Hospital (BCMH), Marquette General Hospital (MGH), and the Upper Peninsula Health Information Exchange (UPHIE).
- **Network Configuration**: Established a common IP address scheme to ensure connectivity between all entities.

### OpenEMR Installation and Configuration

- **Objective**: Installed and configured OpenEMR as the Electronic Health Record (EHR) system for each hospital.
- **Methodology**: Utilized the provided OS templates compatible with OpenEMR and followed the installation guidelines outlined in the assignment documentation and OpenEMR User Guide.
- **Skills Demonstrated**: Proficiency in Linux-based system administration, package installation, and configuration management. Ability to follow technical documentation for software setup and deployment.

### Synthea Data Generation

- **Objective**: Generated synthetic patient and syndromic surveillance data for each hospital using Synthea.
- **Methodology**: Configured Synthea to simulate a disease outbreak scenario across the geographical region based on provided guidelines.
- **Skills Demonstrated**: Familiarity with healthcare data generation tools, proficiency in command-line interface usage, and understanding of data simulation techniques.

### HAPI-FHIR Server Setup

- **Objective**: Installed and configured the HAPI-FHIR server within the UPHIE's virtual machine.
- **Methodology**: Followed the lab assignment instructions provided for HAPI-FHIR installation and configuration.
- **Skills Demonstrated**: Understanding of healthcare interoperability standards, ability to set up and configure web servers, and troubleshooting skills in resolving server-related issues.

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

- **Complexity of Integration**: Integrating multiple software components (OpenEMR, Synthea, HAPI-FHIR) within the virtual machine environment presented challenges in ensuring compatibility and proper functioning.
  - **Solution**: Employed systematic testing and debugging techniques to identify and resolve integration issues.
- **Security Concerns**: Ensuring the security of the configured systems, especially in handling sensitive healthcare data, required meticulous attention to detail.
  - **Solution**: Implemented security best practices as outlined in the assignment documentation and sought assistance from relevant resources when necessary.

## Conclusion

This project showcases my technical proficiency in setting up and configuring complex healthcare IT systems, including Electronic Health Records (EHRs), data generation tools, and interoperability servers. By successfully completing the assigned tasks and addressing technical challenges, I have demonstrated my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios and deliver robust solutions in a healthcare informatics context.
